# Advent of Code 2023
List of problems: https://adventofcode.com/2023/

You can get the problem input data directly into your Python code with [get_data.py](2022_problems/get_data.py). Create a `config.json` file in problems folder and add cookie session to it or just configure it for yourself.
```json
{
	"cookie": "92d5eea06bd8a2c14a......."
}
```
This will also save the input data as a txt file for future reference. Python files are run from the problems folder.

I try to write the first solution as fast as I can, so whatever first comes to mind. After I get the stars I might try to write shorter code for the second solution.
