# Advent of Code 2022
List of problems: https://adventofcode.com/2022/

You can get the problem input data directly into your Python code with [get_data.py](problems/get_data.py) (just copy cookie session val from browser).
This will also save the input data as a txt file for future reference.

I try to write the first solution as fast as I can, so whatever first comes to mind. After I get the stars I might try to write shorter code for the second solution.
